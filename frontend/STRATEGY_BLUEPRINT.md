## 🤖 Phase 3: The Gemini Automation Workflow

### 1. The Prompt Strategy
To rank in India, content *must* feel local. It cannot sound like a generic US bot.

**System Instruction for Gemini (Used in Code):**
> "You are an expert Indian Tech Journalist. You write in British English but use Indian colloquialisms where appropriate. You ALWAYS price items in INR (₹). You reference local platforms like Flipkart, Amazon.in, Jio, and UPI. Your tone is helpful, authoritative, and objective."

### 2. Avoiding Duplicate Content
*   **Remix:** Don't just generate one article. Generate 3 versions (Review, Comparison, Guide) and merge the best parts.
*   **Update:** Ask Gemini to "Add a paragraph about the latest 2025 update" to make it fresher than competitors.

## 📈 Phase 4: 30-Day Traffic Growth Plan

### Days 1-7: The "Seeding" Phase
*   **Social Setup:** Create pages on Instagram, Twitter (X), and a Telegram Channel.
*   **Quora Strategy:** Answer 2 questions daily related to your articles. Paste 80% of your article and link "Read full guide" at the bottom.
*   **WhatsApp:** Create a "Tech Deals & News" channel. Share your link daily.

### Days 8-14: The "Shorts" Phase
*   **YouTube Shorts / Reels:**
    *   Script: "Stop buying the wrong phone! Here are the top 3 phones under 20k."
    *   Visual: Screen recording of your article scrolling.
    *   CTA: "Link in bio."
    *   *Goal:* Viral traffic spike.

### Days 15-30: The "SEO" Phase
*   **Interlinking:** Go back to old articles and link them to new ones.
*   **Backlinks:** Comment on other Indian tech blogs (Beebom, Trak.in) with value, not spam.
*   **Google Discover:** Use high-quality 1200x675px images for every post to trigger Discover feed recommendation.

3.  **Software:** "CRM software India", "HR management tools".
4.  **Education:** "Data Science course fees", "MBA online".
